class FileOrSequence:
    """ The construcutor takes one argument, which may either be a string,
    which is interpreted as a file name (possibly with path), or a
    connection, by which we mean a text file opened for reading, or
    any other object that can provide an iterator over strings
    (lines of the file).

    The advantage of passing a file name instead of an already opened file
    is that if an iterator is requested several times, the file will be
    re-opened each time. If the file is already open, its lines can be read
    only once, and then, the iterator stays exhausted.

    Furthermore, if a file name is passed that end in ".gz" or ".gzip"
    (case insensitive), it is transparently gunzipped.
