Many people have contributed to pysam. The list of github contributors
is the best place to get a full list of authors and their contributions.
The list and summary below is a out-of-date and represents the earlier
stages of the project.

List of contributors:

Andreas Heger, Tildon Grant Belgard, Florian Finkernagel, Leo
Goodstadt, Martin Goodson all contributed code to pysam.

John Marshall has been looking after pysam and its community for
several years, as well as making many code contributions and improving
the engineering of pysam.

Kevin B. Jacobs implemented a Cython wrapper for the VCF/BCF
reader/writer in htslib.

Gerton Lunter provided a validating VCF parser.

Marcel Martin implemented python 3 compatibility.
Ben Schiller contributed a Windows compatible clone.

The sources in the directory samtools are from the samtools project:
http://samtools.sourceforge.net/. All of these are available under the
MIT licence. The attributions for this code are as follows:

Heng Li from the Sanger Institute wrote most of the initial source code
of SAMtools and various converters.

Bob Handsaker from the Broad Institute is a major contributor to the
SAM/BAM specification. He designed and implemented the BGZF format, the
underlying indexable compression format for the BAM format. BGZF does
not support arithmetic between file offsets.

Jue Ruan for the Beijing Genome Institute designed and implemented the
RAZF format, an alternative indexable compression format. RAZF supports
arithmetic between file offsets, at the cost of increased index file
size and the full compatibility with gzip. RAZF is optional and only
used in `faidx' for indexing RAZF compressed fasta files.

Colin Hercus updated novo2sam.pl to support gapped alignment by
novoalign.
